# Capstone Project: Build Your Custom RAG System

Congratulations on making it this far! You've learned all the core concepts needed to build a production-ready RAG system with intelligent agents. Now it's time to put it all together and showcase your work.

---

## Project Overview

For your capstone project, you'll customize and extend the RAG system you've built throughout this course. You have two main options for your data source, and you'll customize the agent architecture to fit your use case.

**Deliverables:**

1. ✅ A fully functional, deployed RAG application
2. ✅ Custom data uploaded to Pinecone
3. ✅ Modified or extended agent system
4. ✅ 5-minute Loom video presentation
5. ✅ Clean, documented code repository

---

## Part 1: Choose Your Data Source (30 minutes)

You have two options:

### Option A: Use Brian's LinkedIn Posts

The easiest option is to use the provided LinkedIn data that's already formatted and ready to go.

**Location:** `app/scripts/data/brian_posts.csv`

**What's included:**

-   80+ professional LinkedIn posts
-   Metadata: impressions, reactions, comments, shares
-   Topics: career advice, tech industry insights, learning strategies
-   Pre-formatted CSV ready for upload

**To upload:**

```bash
# Create a script to parse and upload the CSV
yarn upload-linkedin-data
```

You'll need to create this script based on the patterns you learned in Module 5. The CSV format is:

```csv
urn,text,type,firstName,lastName,numImpressions,numViews,numReactions,numComments,numShares,...
```

**Why choose this option?**

-   ✅ Data is already clean and ready
-   ✅ Consistent format and quality
-   ✅ Known content domain (professional advice)
-   ✅ Focus more time on agent customization

### Option B: Scrape Your Own Data

If you want a fully custom domain, scrape your own data sources.

**Steps:**

1. **Choose your domain:**

    - Your own blog/website
    - Public documentation you find valuable
    - Reddit posts from specific subreddits
    - GitHub repository READMEs
    - Product reviews or testimonials
    - Any public web content

2. **Create your scraping script:**

```typescript
// app/scripts/scrapeCustomData.ts
import { DataProcessor } from '../libs/dataProcessor';
import { openaiClient } from '../libs/openai/openai';
import { pineconeClient } from '../libs/pinecone';

const urls = [
	'https://your-domain.com/page-1',
	'https://your-domain.com/page-2',
	// Add 10-20 URLs
];

async function scrapeAndUpload() {
	const processor = new DataProcessor();
	const chunks = await processor.processUrls(urls);

	// Generate embeddings and upload
	// (Use the pattern from scrapeAndVectorizeContent.ts)
}

scrapeAndUpload();
```

3. **Run your script:**

```bash
npx tsx app/scripts/scrapeCustomData.ts
```

**Why choose this option?**

-   ✅ Fully personalized domain
-   ✅ Practice end-to-end data pipeline
-   ✅ More impressive for portfolio
-   ⚠️ Requires more time and debugging

**Requirements for Option B:**

-   Minimum 10 URLs or 5,000 words of content
-   Content must be public and ethical to scrape
-   Must be properly chunked and vectorized

---

## Part 2: Customize Your Agent System (1-2 hours)

Now that you have data in Pinecone, customize the agent architecture to fit your use case.

### Current Agent Architecture

Your system currently has:

-   **Selector Agent**: Routes queries to the right agent
-   **LinkedIn Agent**: Handles career/professional questions (fine-tuned model)
-   **RAG Agent**: Retrieves context from Pinecone and generates answers

### Your Task: Modify the Agent System

You must make at least **one significant change** to the agent architecture:

#### Option 1: Add a New Agent

Create a new specialized agent for a specific task:

```typescript
// app/agents/analytics.ts
export async function analyticsAgent(
	request: AgentRequest
): Promise<AgentResponse> {
	// Agent that analyzes data patterns
	// Example: "What were the most engaging posts?"

	const systemPrompt = `You are a data analyst specializing in social media metrics...`;

	return streamText({
		model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
		system: systemPrompt,
		prompt: request.query,
	});
}
```

**Ideas for new agents:**

-   Summary agent (creates bullet-point summaries)
-   Code agent (for technical/programming queries)
-   Comparison agent (compares multiple options)
-   Tutorial agent (creates step-by-step guides)

#### Option 2: Remove an Agent

Simplify the system by removing an agent you don't need:

1. Remove agent implementation from `app/agents/`
2. Update the agent types in `app/agents/types.ts`
3. Update the selector agent in `app/api/select-agent/route.ts`
4. Remove the agent from the selector's decision logic

#### Option 3: Chain Agents Together

Create a multi-step workflow where agents collaborate:

```typescript
// Example: Query refinement → RAG retrieval → Summary generation

// Step 1: Refine the query
const refinedQuery = await queryRefinementAgent(request);

// Step 2: Get context from RAG
const context = await ragAgent({ ...request, query: refinedQuery });

// Step 3: Summarize the response
const summary = await summaryAgent({ context, query: refinedQuery });
```

#### Option 4: Modify the Selector Logic

Improve how queries are routed:

-   Add more sophisticated routing rules
-   Use structured outputs to add confidence scores
-   Implement fallback logic when confidence is low
-   Add query classification categories

**Document your changes!** In your README, explain:

-   What you changed and why
-   How it improves the system
-   Examples of queries that benefit from your changes

---

## Part 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (30 minutes)

Before deploying, thoroughly test your system:

### 1. Test Query Routing

Create a test file with diverse queries:

```typescript
// app/tests/test-queries.ts
const testQueries = [
	"What's the best career advice you have?",
	'How do I learn JavaScript?',
	'What were the most popular posts?',
	'Tell me about React hooks',
	// Add 10-15 varied queries
];

// Test each query and verify:
// - Correct agent is selected
// - Response is relevant
// - Sources are cited (for RAG)
```

### 2. Run Agent Tests

```bash
yarn test:selector
```

Make sure your selector agent routes queries correctly.

### 3. Check Edge Cases

Test with:

-   Very short queries ("help")
-   Very long queries (200+ words)
-   Queries outside your domain
-   Queries with typos or bad grammar

### 4. Verify Data Quality

Check your Pinecone index:

```typescript
const stats = await index.describeIndexStats();
console.log('Total vectors:', stats.totalRecordCount);
// Should match your expected chunk count
```

---

## Part 4: Deploy Your Application (30 minutes)

Deploy your RAG system so others can use it.

### Deployment with Vercel

1. **Prepare for deployment:**

```bash
# Make sure all environment variables are set
# Create .env.local with:
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_INDEX=...
HELICONE_API_KEY=...
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Settings → Environment Variables
```

3. **Test deployment:**

-   Visit your Vercel URL
-   Test multiple queries
-   Check Helicone dashboard for logs
-   Verify everything works in production

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Review the curriculum modules** - Go back to specific sections
2. **Check existing implementations** - Look at how other agents work
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't try to do everything at once
4. **Use Helicone** - Check your API calls and errors
5. **Debug systematically** - Verify each component separately

---

## What's Next?

After completing your capstone:

1. **Share your work** - Post on LinkedIn/Twitter
2. **Add to portfolio** - Showcase on your website
3. **Keep improving** - Add new features and agents
4. **Explore advanced topics:**
    - Multi-modal RAG (images + text)
    - Agentic workflows with tool calling
    - Custom fine-tuning your own models
    - Advanced caching and optimization
